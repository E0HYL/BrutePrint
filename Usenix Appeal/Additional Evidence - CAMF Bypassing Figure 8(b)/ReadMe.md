I've included several files to underscore my integral role in the creation of Figure 8(b). These files include `raw_logs`, which are raw vendor logs I used as a reference to depict the attack sequence in the figure, the `initial_drafts` that represent my first version of the figure, and two sets of WeChat exchanges.

The WeChat exchanges are categorized into two types:

1. `wechat_exchange_1 (drafts in file transfer)`

   This section comprises conversations with myself using WeChat's 'File Transfer' feature from July 15th to July 17th, 2021. During this period, I shared drafts of the figure, with the `initial_draft` corresponding to the first instance of `bypass_log.svg` in the conversation.

2. `wechat_exchange_2 (discussion with Yu Chen)`

   This part contains dialogues with Yu Chen spanning from July 16th, 2020, to July 17th, 2021. These exchanges illustrate our collaborative discussions on minor modifications to my initial version, reinforcing my significant contributions.

These files provide tangible evidence of my substantial involvement in crafting this vital figure for our manuscript.
